Replace contact text with buttons (email button, etc.)

Add contact form.

### Reviews/Testimonials/Case Studies
After getting a promo video, move reviews to their own page and put them in cards -- perhaps the same kind of quasi-card currently used on the home page.

### Home
Promotional, showing a portrait session.

Add "learn more" or arrow, taking user to a different page.

## Feature Ideas

### Services Page
Turn each service into a clickable card. Popup with service details.

Add a CTA to each card. CTA links to contact page's form (#)

Move "Equipment" to a card for subcontracting

### Gallery Page

// Convert selector to a scroll wheel. Add a second wheel, for selecting category (portraits, etc.) ... Actually, I don't want to render my non-portrait images in a lightbox. Too easy to steal high res versions.

### NJGallery

Add arrows to lightbox. Optional render.

### Blog
Use it to cover company news, not just sessions?

### Leaflet
- Show cluster images below map.
- Prior to cluster selection, show text-list of all images.
- Link text list to map zoom upon click
